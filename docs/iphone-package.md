# Jailbroken iPhone Package

The production jailbroken iPhone package is built from `backend-swift/` as `wiki.qaq.unfaird`. It serves the built React frontend, exposes the `/api/*` surface used by the web app and local HTTP clients, runs Apple protocol requests on the Swift backend, downloads Apple CDN IPAs, injects SINF and metadata, decrypts the IPA locally through unfaird, and serves completed IPA files back to the frontend.

It intentionally does not install IPAs locally. The completed decrypted package remains in `DATA_DIR/packages`, and the frontend downloads it through `/api/packages/{id}/file`.

## Decryption Flow

The integrated Swift backend exposes the same API contract as `../unfairdaemon/unfair.sh`:

```text
POST /api/v1/decrypt multipart field ipa
GET queue.ready_url
GET queue.download_url
```

The AssppWeb download API calls this local decrypt path directly inside the same launchd service.

## Apple Protocol Flow

The frontend calls Swift API routes for Apple operations:

```text
POST /api/apple/authenticate
POST /api/apple/purchase
POST /api/apple/versions
POST /api/apple/version-metadata
POST /api/downloads/apple
```

`backend-swift` resolves the bag endpoint, authenticates with the per-account device identifier, records storefront and pod, merges Apple cookies, acquires licenses, resolves CDN download info, creates the download task, injects metadata, and runs local decryption.

## Build

```bash
make build
```

`make build` creates one complete rootless deb containing:

- the Vite frontend from `frontend/dist`
- the Swift/Vapor backend binary
- Swift runtime libraries required by the iOS binary
- the launchd plist and maintainer scripts

Install the generated package on a jailbroken iPhone:

```bash
make install DEVICE_HOST=root@<device-host>
```

The same root install target accepts Theos device variables:

```bash
THEOS=/Users/libr/theos THEOS_DEVICE_IP=<device-host> make install
```

## Runtime Layout

```text
/var/jb/usr/share/assppweb/
  public/

/var/jb/usr/local/lib/unfaird/
  UnfairDaemon
  libswift*.dylib

/var/mobile/AssppWebData/
  packages/
  tasks.json
```

On Dopamine/rootless, the executable is staged by Theos under the package install prefix and signed with `ldid`.
